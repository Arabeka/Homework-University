<p>These samples illustrate the use of the Amzi! Logic Server from C++.</p>
<p><i>Note - At of the Gnu 3.2 release standard use of exception classes causes 
  segmentation faults, so when C++ applications are built with Gnu, Logic Server 
  exceptions are thrown as pointers to the exception objects, rather than as references.</i></p>
<p><a href="hello/console/doc.html">Hello / Console</a> - The Hello Prolog example 
  implemented as a C++ class running as a console application. Should be run from 
  the console. </p>
<p><a href="hello/win32_mfc/doc.html">Hello / Win32_MFC</a> - The Hello Prolog 
  example implemented as a C++ class running in a simple MFC dialog application. 
</p>
<p><a href="pets/doc.html">Pets</a> - The trivial Pets expert system showing a 
  simple architecture for expert system services. Should be run from the console. 
</p>
<p><a href="pets_callback/doc.html">Pets_Callback</a> - A slightly more complex 
  version of Pets in which the Prolog program has a prompt/2 predicate used to 
  get information from the user. In the example, it is used to ask the user for 
  the sound the pet makes. </p>
<p>prompt/2 is implemented as an extended predicate in the C++ class derived from 
  LogicServer, illustrating the technique of having extended predicates associated 
  with instances of classes derived from the Logic Server. 
<p>This is a trivial console example, where there is no real point in having multiple 
  instances of the prompt/2 predicate, but the technique is important for GUI 
  applications where, for example, different instances of the Logic Server might 
  be associated with different windows on the screen. 
<p><a href="win32_rubik_multi/doc.html">Win32_Rubik_Multi</a> - The Win32_Rubik_Multi 
  (MultiThreaded) sample is an MDI MFC application. Each child window has an unfolded 
  view of a Rubik's cube and a 'Solve' button. When the button is pressed, the 
  cube is randomly scrambled and then solved. 
<p>The FILE/NEW menu item causes new child windows to be created, and each one 
  is associated with a new Logic Server, running in a separate thread. 
<p>When you click the 'Solve' button in multiple windows, each one shows a cube 
  being solved at the same (or as close to same as NT multi-threading allows) 
  time. 
<p>This demo was derived from the Microsoft multi-threaded 'Bounce' sample, with 
  solving Rubik's cube replacing the bouncing balls.
