<p>The Win32_Rubik_Multi (MultiThreaded) sample is an MDI MFC application. Each 
  child window has an unfolded view of a Rubik's cube and a 'Solve' button. When 
  the button is pressed, the cube is randomly scrambled and then solved.</p>
<p>This demo was much more interesting in the days of slower machines. Now each 
  cube solves so fast you can't get them all going at once. A good enhancement 
  would be to add a 'Solve All' menu item that automatically sent the solve message 
  to all the cubes so maybe a bunch could be solved at once.</p>
<p>The FILE/NEW menu item causes new child windows to be created, and each one 
  is associated with a new Logic Server, running in a separate thread. 
<p>When you click the 'Solve' button in multiple windows, each one shows a cube 
  being solved at the same (or as close to same as NT multi-threading allows) 
  time. 
<p>This demo was derived from the Microsoft multi-threaded 'Bounce' sample, with 
  solving Rubik's cube replacing the bouncing balls. 
<h2>Building the Sample</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a project in the Eclipse IDE called cubemt in the win32_rubik_multi 
    sample directory.</li>
  <li>Set the properties of the project (right mouse button while mouse on project 
    in navigator) to output to rubik.xpl, not in the default bin directory.</li>
  <li>Open the Microsoft Visual C++ Project CubeMT.sln and build CubeMT.exe.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Run debug\CubeMT.exe (or release depending on which you built)</li>
  <li>Select File/New to create a new Rubik's cube, then click on Solve to solve 
    it.</li>
</ol>
