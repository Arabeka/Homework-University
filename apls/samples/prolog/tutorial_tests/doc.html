<h1>Tutorial Testing - Prolog sample</h1>
<p>This sample illustrate a knowledge engineering approach for building intelligent 
  tests, and also illustrates an architecture for knowledgebase applications in 
  general.</p>
<p>The idea behind tutorial testing is the test is used to learn what the student 
  knows and doesn't know, and uses that knowledge to point to pertinent tutorial 
  texts and to provide further testing in the problem areas.</p>
<p>Comments in the code provide documentation.</p>
<p>To run the system from the listener:</p>
<ul><pre>
?- [tutor_test_ui].

yes
?- main.
what's 2 + 5 10
you're confusing + with *
what's 3 + 5 8
good
what's 2 * 5 4
read multiplication chapter

yes
?- main.
what's 2 + 5 6
read addition chapter
what's 3 + 5 15
you're confusing + with *
what's 2 * 5 10
good

yes
</pre></ul>
<p>The knowledgebase architecture is represented in the file structure:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>tutor_test_ui.pro</b> - A command line user interface to the program. 
    The same logic could be coded in a host language, such as Java or VB, as well. 
    The I/O predicates of the engine are defined in the interface code, so extended 
    predicates in Java or VB could be used for a GUI front-end.</li>
  <li><b>tutor_test_engine.pro</b> - The reasoning engine for the tutorial test. 
    It asks a question, and then based on the answer decides what to tell the 
    student and what to do next.</li>
  <li><b>tutor_test_math.pro</b> - A simple math test that illustrates how to 
    develop a test using the tutorial test program. </li>
</ul>
