% Tutorial test Prolog user interface

% The engine is designed to be called from
% any host language, and expects the host
% language to provide the I/O predicates it
% uses.
%
% These are prompt/2 and output/1.
%
% This way a Prolog test harness can be built
% debugging and testing in a pure Prolog
% environment.
%
% The system can then also be deployed from
% a language that supports GUIs, and have the
% I/O predicates implemented as extended predicates
% in that language.
