<h1>ChatBots and Ontologies</h1>
<p>The two types of AI application studied are chat bots (<a href="http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0307.htm">July 
  2003 newsletter</a>) and ontologies (<a href="http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0306.htm">June 
  2003 newsletter</a>).</p>
<p>Both are perfect examples of the ideas expressed in the first newsletter (<a href="http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0211.htm">November 
  2002</a>) about AI applications in general. Both require a knowledge representation 
  language and a reasoning engine that knows how to apply that knowledge.</p>
<p>In the case of chat bots, the knowledge is patterns of inputs and responses 
  that drive a dialog. In the case of ontologies, the knowledge is relationships 
  and attributes of words and concepts.</p>
<p>A chat bot tool provides a way to represent the knowledge and a way to deploy 
  it. An ontology tool does the same.</p>
<p>There are chat bot and ontology tools available, and good ones at that, but 
  they suffer the problems of all AI tools. They make assumptions about how and 
  what types of knowledge can be represented, and further, on how that knowledge 
  is deployed.</p>
<p>If the assumptions fit an application area, that's great. But if not... Well 
  that's a very practical line of reasoning. The simple truth is, its a lot more 
  fun to play with your own knowledge representation and reasoning engine, and, 
  you can get it to do exactly what you want.</p>
<p>The programs can be written in any programming language, but we'll use Prolog 
  in the newsletter because it is particularly versatile for a rapid prototyping 
  and experimentation approach to AI concepts, as well as being very compact and 
  fitting better in a newsletter.</p>
<p>Logic programs have the added benefit that they read much like program specifications 
  and can be used for the design of applications intended for implementation in 
  other languages. So if you don't like Prolog, read along and code in Lisp, Mozart, 
  Java or the language of your choice. For those that don't know Prolog, there 
  are boxes with explanatory notes.</p>
<p>One final note. Design decisions for the programs were always made in favor 
  of clarity, sometimes at the expense of performance, although this will not 
  be an issue until the knowledge base for either program grows to a large size.</p>
<h2><a name="chat_bot"></a>Chat Bot</h2>
<p>Chat bot is the generic name for programs derived from Weizenbaum's original 
  Eliza program, which mimicked a therapist. Eliza was written almost as a joke, 
  to show how mindless pattern-matching rules can be used to generate realistic 
  conversations, thus proving the software was NOT intelligent. Yet chat bots 
  have come closer to passing the Turing test than other types of programs, and 
  Richard Wallace hypothesizes that that is because much human dialog is, in fact, 
  mindless pattern-matching.</p>
<h3>Pronoun Reversal</h3>
<p>One of the main insights in Eliza was how much can be done simply by changing 
  the grammatical person of a sentence, like 'I' to 'you' and 'mine' to 'yours'. 
  This is called pronoun reversal. We'll start with a very simple, and extremely 
  annoying chat bot that does only that, and adds a question mark at the end.</p>
<p>To represent the knowledge of which words to reverse, we'll use Prolog facts, 
  which are logically the same as relations in a relational database. Here's the 
  few we'll use for testing, in a relation call <b>me_you/2</b>, the /2 indicating 
  there are two arguments.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">me_you(me,you).
me_you(i,you).
me_you(my,your).
me_you(am,are).</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The choice of the me_you/2 predicate was the first design decision about knowledge 
  representation.</p>
<h3>Input/Output</h3>
<p>The reasoning engine needs an interface to the user or caller. For the chat 
  bot all that is required is a predicate (like a function) that takes an input 
  string of user text and puts out a response string. A predicate <b>respond</b> 
  with two arguments, the input and the response, provides that service. It is 
  refered to in Prolog as <b>respond/2</b>.</p>
<p>Any application that can call Prolog could be used to provide the dialog interface 
  with the user, and Prolog is certainly a language that can call Prolog. Here's 
  a simple loop for a console version of the program that can also be run in a 
  Prolog listener (interpreter).</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">main :-
   write('DDJ AI Expert ChatBot Sample'), nl,
   repeat,
   write('> '), read_string(InputString),
   respond(InputString, ResponseString),
   write(ResponseString), nl,
   InputString == `quit`.</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="10" bordercolor="#000099" bgcolor="#DFFFFF">
  <tr> 
    <td>A Prolog <b>logic base</b>, or program, is made up of logical <b>clauses</b> 
      that define <b>predicates</b>. This one is simple. The predicate is called 
      <b>main/0</b> (the /0 indicating no arguments) and has only one clause. 
      After the neck<b> :-</b> symbol are a comma separated list of <b>goals</b>, 
      which typically call other predicates. The most important one here is <b>respond/2</b>, 
      which will do the real work. Logical variables are indicated by an initial 
      upper case letter, such as <b>InputString</b>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Core Pattern Matcher</h3>
<p>How should a sentence be represented internally by the program? Thinking of 
  the sentence as a list of words seems like a good starting point. Proceeding 
  in a top-down manner, here is the implementation of <b>respond/2</b>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">respond(InputString, ResponseString) :-
   string_to_list(InputString, InputWordList),
   swap_person(InputWordList, SwappedWordList),
   form_response(SwappedWordList, ResponseWordList),
   list_to_string(ResponseWordList, ResponseString),
   !.</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="10" bordercolor="#000099" bgcolor="#DFFFFF">
  <tr> 
    <td>The <b>!</b>, called <b>cut</b>, is used to turn off Prolog's automatic 
      backtracking search for multiple solutions for a given rule. In this case, 
      we only want one response for each user input.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The first and last goal of respond/2 perform the service of converting strings 
  to and from lists of words. For experimentation, those steps could be simply 
  eliminated, using lists directly for input and output. For final use, those 
  steps should be quite nice, dealing with punctuation and capitalization. For 
  now, we'll make use of simple built-in predicates that do the conversion for 
  us but require everything in lower case. Later nicer versions of these can be 
  implemented.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">string_to_list(String, List) :-
   string_tokens(String, List).

list_to_string(List, String) :-
   stringlist_concat(List, ` `, String).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="10" bordercolor="#000099" bgcolor="#DFFFFF">
  <tr> 
    <td>The utility predicates for dealing with strings and lists are not part 
      of the ISO standard for Prolog, so different implementations support different 
      ones. They are all relatively easy to write in Prolog. The two used here, 
      <b>string_tokens/2</b> and <b>stringlist_concat/3</b> are part of Amzi! 
      Prolog. You might have to find equivalents for other Prologs, or, simply 
      skip this step and use lists directly for input and output.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Next to implement is the real guts of the program where the <b>me_you/2</b> 
  knowledge is applied in the first step of creating a response. Recursion is 
  typically used to process lists in Prolog. The recursive rules to replace the 
  pronouns in a list of words are:</p>
<p><b>boundary condition</b> - The list is empty, we're done.<br>
  <b>recursive condition</b> - Take the first word in the list and call <b>swap_word/2</b> 
  to see what the replacement word is. Put that word in the output list and recursively 
  call the rest of input list to generate the rest of the output list.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">swap_person([], []).
swap_person([X|Xs], [Y|Ys]) :-
   swap_word(X,Y),
   !, swap_person(Xs,Ys).
</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="10" bordercolor="#000099" bgcolor="#DFFFFF">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <p><b>[H|T]</b> is Prolog notation for separating a list into its head (first 
        element), and tail (remainder of the list). This allows for the easy writing 
        of recursive rules where some operation is performed on the head, and 
        the tail is then used as the argument to the next recursion. The empty 
        list is represented by [] and usually signifies the boundary condition 
        for a recursion.</p>
      <p>So, for example, when <b>swap_person/2</b> is called with the input list 
        [i,want,pizza], the pattern [X|Xs] is mapped to it in a process called 
        <b>unification</b>. X becomes i, Xs becomes [want,pizza]. swap_word/2 
        will unify Y with you and Ys will become what ever is returned by calling 
        <b>swap_person/2</b> with [want,pizza].</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The <b>swap_word/2</b> rules look in the knowledge base portion of the program 
  to see if the word is one mentioned in the <b>me_you/2</b> relation. If its 
  not, the word is replaced with itself.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">swap_word(X,Y) :- me_you(X,Y).
swap_word(X,Y) :- me_you(Y,X).
swap_word(W,W).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>One last bit and we're ready to run. We form the response, for now, by simply 
  adding a question mark on the end.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">form_response(In,Out) :-
   append(In, [?], Out).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><b>append/3</b> is a common list utility in Prolog that appends one list to 
  another. In this case we're adding the list with the single element, ?, to the 
  end of our output list of words. To use a library of common list utilities we 
  need these two lines at the front of the program. We'll use other list utilities 
  later as well. (If you don't have a library, the implementations of various 
  list utility predicates can be readily found and coded directly in the program.)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">:- load(list).
:- import(list).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>We're now ready to load the program into a Prolog listener and see how it runs.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">?- consult(chatbot).
yes
?- main.

you have problems with your computer ?
> yes
yes ?
> will you help me
will i help you ?
> quit

yes</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It's already sounding like some people I know.</p>
<h3>Adding Response Patterns</h3>
<p>The &quot;intelligence&quot; of a chat bot lies in the patterns it is told 
  to recognize. Lists of words and variables can represent a pattern to look for, 
  and lists that have those same variables in them can be used for various possible 
  responses.</p>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="10" bordercolor="#000099" bgcolor="#DFFFFF">
  <tr> 
    <td>There are two types of logical variables in Prolog. Named ones, beginning 
      with an upper case letter, and anonymous ones, represented by an underscore. 
      The named variables can be used to echo parts of the input back, and anonymous 
      ones for indicating we don't care about parts of the input.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Here's two responses for any input that has the adjacent words &quot;blue screen&quot; 
  in it.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">response( [_,blue,screen,_],
  [ [why,do,you,use,windows,?],
    [wipe,your,computer,clean,and,install,linux,'.'] ]).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a response pattern for any input with the word &quot;linux&quot; in 
  it.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">response( [_,linux,_],
  [ [nobody,supports,linux,'.'] ]).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That should drive them nuts.</p>
<p>Here's a few more response patterns that might come in handy to keep the conversation 
  going. The last one is a catch all that is used if none of the other patterns 
  match. It does the job of echoing the input with a question mark. Remember that 
  the input word lists have already had the pronouns swapped before they are used 
  in these patterns.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">response( [yes,_],
  [ [why,?] ]).
response( [no,_],
  [ [why,not,?] ]).
response( [_,you,like,X],
  [ [how,can,you,like,X,?],
    [is,it,strange,to,like,X,?] ]).
response( [_,want,to,X],<br>  [ [why,would,you,want,to,X,?],<br>    [you,can,not,X,'.'],<br>    [is,it,dangerous,to,X,?] ]).<br>response( [X],
  [ [X,?] ]).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="10" bordercolor="#000099" bgcolor="#DFFFFF">
  <tr> 
    <td>When a named variable appears multiple times in a rule, like X in the 
      above patterns gets a value, all occurances of X automatically have the 
      same value. So when the pattern matcher we will write determines a value 
      of X from the input pattern, then that value will be echoed in the output 
      patterns.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Before looking at the code, here's how these response rules will drive a dialog 
  with the chat bot.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">?- main.
DDJ AI Expert ChatBot Sample
> i get a blue screen on my computer
wipe your computer clean and install linux .
> ok, i did that but now i cannot get linux to work.
nobody supports linux .</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>When there are multiple response patterns to pick from, the engine will pick 
  one at random. Here's another run with the same rules, but a different result.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>
<font color="#000099">> i get a blue screen on my computer
why do you use windows ?
> i like the windows operating system
is it strange to like the windows operating system ?
> no
why not ?
> lots of people like windows
lots of people like windows ?
> yes
why ?
> it is easy to use
it is easy to use ?</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Response Pattern Matcher</b></p>
<p>The tricky part of the pattern matcher is setting a variable to possibly multiple 
  words in the input. For example, in the response pattern [_,want,to,X] X might 
  match a phrase. That phrase is best represented as a list of words as well, 
  so we will have an output list with embedded lists in it. A list utility, <b>flatten/2</b>, 
  will fix that problem.</p>
<p>For example if the input is [i,want,to,learn,to,fly] X will be bound to [learn,to,fly] 
  and the outputs will look like [why,would,you,want,to,[learn,to,fly]]. <b>flatten/2</b> 
  converts that to [why,would,you,want,to,learn,to,fly].</p>
<p>Here is a new version of <b>form_response/2</b> that uses the <b>response/2</b> 
  rules in the knowledge base portion of the application.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">form_response(Input,Response) :-
   response(InputPattern, ResponsePatterns),
   match(InputPattern, Input),
   random_elem(ResponsePatterns, ResponsePattern),
   flatten(ResponsePattern, Response).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="10" bordercolor="#000099" bgcolor="#DFFFFF">
  <tr> 
    <td>This rule makes use of Prolog automatic backtracking search to find the 
      right response rule. It first picks a <b>response/2</b> and then uses <b>match/2</b> 
      to see if its pattern matches the input. If it doesn't, then Prolog backtracks 
      and tries the next <b>response/2</b> rule. When it finds one that matches, 
      it picks one of the possible response outputs, flattens the list and returns 
      the response.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Here's the recursive rules that try to match the input word list with a pattern 
  in one of the response rules. It will be called with the input pattern from 
  a rule and its job will be to see if that pattern can be matched with the user's 
  input. Further, if there are variables in the input pattern, then the binding 
  for those variables will be determined as well.</p>
<p>There are two boundary conditions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One is when the the word list for the input pattern is empty, meaning the 
    pattern matcher succeeded.</li>
  <li>The other is when the only element left in the input pattern is a variable, 
    in which case the pattern also succeeds and the variable is bound to whatever 
    is left in the user input.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two recursive cases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the next element in the input pattern list is a variable, a separate 
    predicate is called to gather words from the user input up until the next 
    specific word in the input pattern is encountered.</li>
  <li>When the next element is a specific word, then if it matches the user input, 
    recursion continues.</li>
</ul>
If the input doesn't match, none of the four <b>match/2</b> rules will succeed 
and the call to <b>match/2</b> fails, triggering backtracking search for another 
<b>response/2</b>. 
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">match([], []).
match([Xs], IWs) :-
   var(Xs),
   !,
   Xs = IWs.
match([Xs,W|PWs], IWs) :-
   var(Xs),
   !,
   fill_var(Xs, W, IWs, IWsLeft),
   match([W|PWs], IWsLeft).
match([W|PWs], [W|IWs]) :-
   !,
   match(PWs, IWs).</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><b>fill_var/4</b> is another recursive predicate that walks the input list 
  looking for the first occurance of a word that matches the word after the variable. 
  It has four arguments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the output list of words, returned to caller;</li>
  <li>the next word in the input pattern that cause recursion to stop when its 
    found;</li>
  <li>the user input list being walked, looking for the stop word;</li>
  <li>the remainder of the input list, returned for the caller for further processing.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">fill_var([], W, [W|IWs], [W|IWs]) :-
   !.
fill_var([X|Xs], W, [X|IWs], IWsLeft) :-
   fill_var(Xs, W, IWs, IWsLeft).</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easy in Prolog to test individual predicates such as this one. When the 
  program is loaded in a Prolog listener, any of the predicates can be queried 
  directly. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">?- match([a,b,c], [a,b,c]).
yes

?- match([a,X,d], [a,b,c,d]).
X = [b, c] 
yes

?- match([_,like,X], [you,like,to,fly,planes]).
X = [to, fly, planes] 
yes

?- match([_,like,X], [you,want,to,fly,planes]).
no

?- match([a,b,c], [a,r,c]).
no</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are new to Prolog, the best way to learn to understand code like this 
  is to run it in a debugger, which will provide a trace of Prolog execution and 
  variable bindings. Here is a trace of <b>form_response/2</b> from one type of 
  Prolog debugger.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This trace illustrates that the rules are tried in the order they appear. So 
  if a user input might match multiple response patterns, the first one will have 
  priority.</p>
<p>At this point, all the code is here that is needed to run the program and get 
  the results displayed a few paragraphs back.</p>
<h3>Enhancements</h3>
<p>There are a number of enhancements that can be made to the sample.</p>
<p>Implement better formatting of input and output strings.</p>
<p>Put the knowledge in a separate file, so different sets of pattern matching 
  rules can be used. Let the user can pick from a menu of rule files.</p>
<p>Indexing of response rules by key words in the patterns can be added. So for 
  example, rules that match the word 'can' might be indexed on 'can'. This can 
  be used for greater efficiency if a very large number of patterns are coded, 
  and it can be used to easily let one pattern refer to another for completion.</p>
<p>Memory of past variable bindings can be kept and popped back in from time to 
  time. So we might remember the user liked pizza and if nothing else matches, 
  have a response that uses the memory to ask a question about pizza.</p>
<p>Add facts similar to the <b>me_you/2</b> facts that can be used to map a variety 
  of input words into a single word used for pattern matching. For example, 'need' 
  might map to 'want' so the rules matching 'want' will also work if the user 
  types 'need'. Also it would be nice if the these facts used lists of words, 
  rather than being restricted to single words.</p>
<p>And of course creating more and more response patterns to make the chat bot 
  more interesting.</p>
<h2><a name="ontology"></a>Ontology</h2>
<p>Tools for ontologies are easy to create and play with in Prolog. As always, 
  first a knowledge representation for the ontology is determined, and then tools 
  to use it are developed.</p>
<h3>Knowledge Representation</h3>
<p>The entries for the ontology can be stored as property lists, where each word 
  has a property list associated with it. A property list is just a list whose 
  elements are Property = Value. Using this idea for representing ontological 
  knowledge, here's some entries we might want to support an application about 
  food.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">word(pizza, [
  kind_of = food,
  contains = cheese,
  contains = tomato ]).
word(broccoli, [
  kind_of = food,
  color = green ]).
word(donut, [
  kind_of = food,
  contains = sugar ]).
word(spaghetti_sauce, [
  kind_of = food,
  contains = tomato ]).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's some more entries about people and allergies.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">word(joe, [
  instance_of = person,
  allergy = tomato ]).
word(jill, [
  instance_of = person,
  allergy = cheese ]).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Reasoning Engine</h3>
<p>Now, armed with typical list utilities we can write a predicate that can answer 
  questions about the properties of words in our ontology.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">property(Word, Property, Value) :-
   word(Word, PropertyList),
   member(Property = Value, PropertyList).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="10" bordercolor="#000099" bgcolor="#DFFFFF">
  <tr> 
    <td>Because Prolog is just matching patterns itself, the <b>property/3</b>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>Here's some things we can do with <b>property/3</b> in the listener. (The semicolon 
  tells Prolog to look for another solution, so in these queries we find all solutions.)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">?- property(pizza, contains, X).
X = cheese ;
X = tomato ;
no

?- property(X, kind_of, food).
X = pizza ;
X = broccoli ;
X = donut ;
X = spaghetti_sauce ;
no

?- property(X, kind_of, food), property(X, color, green).
X = broccoli ;
no

?- findall(X, property(pizza, contains, X), L).
X = H19
L = [cheese, tomato] 
yes</font>
</pre>

<h3>Applications of the Ontology</h3>
<p>The ontology we developed can be used to support other applications. The types 
  of information we stored in the small sample can be used, for example, in an 
  expert system that warns people about what foods they can and cannot eat based 
  on allergies.</p>
<p>The rules of that expert system might be written directly in Prolog. Each of 
  these rules finds a person word and a food word and compares the allergy of 
  the person with what the food contains.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">can_eat(Person, Food) :-
  property(Person, instance_of, person),
  property(Person, allergy, Allergy),
  property(Food, kind_of, food),
  not property(Food, contains, Allergy).

cannot_eat(Person, Food) :-
  property(Person, instance_of, person),
  property(Person, allergy, Allergy),
  property(Food, kind_of, food),
  property(Food, contains, Allergy).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the ontology has changed the knowledge engineering task for this 
  allergy expert system. Without the ontology, the knowledge would all be stored 
  in the rules. With the ontology, the rules become simple general purpose rules 
  and the knowledge is stored in the ontology.</p>
<p>Here's how these two rules can be used.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">?- can_eat(joe, pizza).
no

?- can_eat(joe, donut).
yes

?- can_eat(joe, X).
X = broccoli ;
X = donut ;
no

?- cannot_eat(joe, X).
X = pizza ;
X = spaghetti_sauce ;
no

?- can_eat(X, broccoli).
X = joe ;
X = jill ;
no</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Transitivity</h3>
<p>Transitivity is an easy enhancement to add to the ontology engine. Transitivity 
  applies for certain properties, such as <b>kind_of</b>. It means that if X <b>kind_of</b> 
  Y and Y <b>kind_of</b> Z then X <b>kind_of</b> Z. We can define certain properties 
  as transitive by specifying it in the knowledge base.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">transitive(kind_of).
transitive(contains).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now if we're looking for a value for a property that is transitive, our engine 
  can recursively call itself.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">property(Word, Property, Value) :-
   word(Word, PropertyList),
   member(Property = Value, PropertyList).
property(Word, Property, Value) :-
   transitive(Property),
   word(Word, PropertyList),
   member(Property = Word2, PropertyList),
   property(Word2, Property, Value).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To test it make one small change to the ontology, have pizza contain spaghetti_sauce 
  instead of tomato.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">word(pizza, [
  kind_of = food,
  contains = cheese,
  contains = spaghetti_sauce ]).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p> The test will be to see if joe is still not allowed to eat pizza, as the pizza 
  does not directly contain tomato.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">?- property(pizza, contains, X).
X = cheese ;
X = spaghetti_sauce ;
X = tomato ;
no

?- can_eat(joe, pizza).
no

?- cannot_eat(joe, pizza).
yes</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="chat_bot_ontology"></a>Chat Bot with Ontology</h2>
<p>We can use the ontology we developed to add more intelligence to the patterns 
  in the chat bot rules. In particular we can specify properties to include in 
  the pattern match. Here's a pattern that recognizes when the user is talking 
  about food.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">response( [_,property(W,kind_of,food),_],
  [ [are,you,talking,about,W,because,you,are,hungry,'?'],
    [when,did,you,last,eat,W,'?'] ]).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's some to add to the annoying behavior of our technical support.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">response( [_,property(W,kind_of,windows),_],
  [ [you,should,dump,W,and,switch,to,unix,'.'] ]).
response( [_,property(W,kind_of,unix),_],
  [ [you,should,dump,W,and,switch,to,windows,'.'] ]).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>These last two require the addition of some more information in the ontology.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">word(windows, [
  kind_of = operating_system ]).
word(unix, [
  kind_of = operating_system ]).
word(xp, [
  kind_of = windows ]).
word(w2000, [
  kind_of = windows ]).
word(linux, [
  kind_of = unix ]).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And we have to make some small changes to the basic pattern matcher to recognize 
  and handle these property patterns in the rules. The new clauses are indicated 
  in red.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">match([], []).
match([Xs], IWs) :-
   var(Xs),
   !,
   Xs = IWs.
match([Xs,W|PWs], IWs) :-
   var(Xs),
   !,
   fill_var(Xs, W, IWs, IWsLeft),
   match([W|PWs], IWsLeft).
<font color="#CC0000">match([property(W,P,V)|PWs], [W|IWs]) :-
   property(W,P,V),
   !,
   match(PWs,IWs).</font>
match([W|PWs], [W|IWs]) :-
   !,
   match(PWs, IWs).

fill_var([], W, [W|IWs], [W|IWs]) :-
   !.
<font color="#CC0000">fill_var([], property(W,P,V), [W|IWs], [W|IWs]) :-
   property(W,P,V),
   !.</font>
fill_var([X|Xs], W, [X|IWs], IWsLeft) :-
   fill_var(Xs, W, IWs, IWsLeft).</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Trying the new pattern rules we get a dialog like this.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">?- main.
