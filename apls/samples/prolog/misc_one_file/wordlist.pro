/*  WORDLIST.PRO -- Read word list
**
**  Read word list reads in a list of chars (terminated with a !, . or ?)
**  and converts it to a list of atomic entries (including numbers).
**  Uppercase is converted to lower case.  Based on code in
**  "Programming in Prolog" by Clocksin & Mellish.
**
**  A 'word' is one item in our generated list
**
**  This code can be modified to include whatever separators you need
**  and whatever termination criteria you need.
