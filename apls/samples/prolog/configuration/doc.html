<h1>Configuration - Prolog sample</h1>
<p>The configuration sample is an initial prototype for a configuration system, 
  using door units as a sample. It uses an architecture that separates the generic 
  configuration reasoning predicates from the specific configuration knowledge, 
  in this case for door units.</p>
<p>As it is a prototype, the knowledge uses a subset of Prolog. With a little 
  more work the knowlegdge could be stored in a format easier for the lay person 
  to understand. The work would involve putting more of the work in the configuration 
  reasoning engine.</p>
<p>It uses a subset of Prolog to store the knowledge for a particular domain. 
  Configurations are built up using Prolog's ability to create a structure from 
  the top down, filling in the 'holes' as the configuration process proceeds.</p>
<p>Comments in the code provide documentation.</p>
<p>To run the system from the listener:</p>
<ul><pre>
?- consult(configure_ui).
?- main.
</pre></ul>
<p>The files in the sample are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>configure_ui.pro</b> - A command line user interface to the program. 
    The same logic could be coded in a host language, such as Java or VB, as well.</li>
  <li><b>configure.pro</b> - The predicates that support the configuration process. 
    These are generic so they can be used with any knowledge base in the correct 
    format.</li>
  <li><b>configure_door.pro</b> - A small sample configuration knowledge base 
    for door units. </li>
</ul>
