% Configuration rules for doors
%
% This is the product-specific knowledge base for doors.
% The idea is this file could be replaced for other
% domains.
%
% It is a bit of a hybrid.  With more time, a better
% representation might be found.  The idea is this is just
% the declarative specification of the configuration and
% bill of materials rules.  (Pricing could be added as well.)
%
% With the current version of the system, the experts would
% edit this text file.  But it would not be difficult to create
% a GUI front-end that served as an editor on such a file, so
% the user wouldn't have to worry about all the punctuation. In
% other words, the GUI would create these structures.
%
% That is exactly what KnowledgeWright (KW) does.  If we were to
% build a configuration jig for KW we would do a little more
% work on this knowledge representation, and allow it to be
% edited with the KW GUI test and development environment.
%
% The file configure.pro contains the reasoning logic for
% this file, and it would be the basis for implementing a
% customized reasoning engine for a KW Configure Jig.
%
% There are two ways to represent and build the tree structure
% representing the product.  The more classic approach would
% be to create linked clauses, like database rows, that defined
% the emerging configuration.  This would be done with a
% data-driven forward-chaining reasoning engine.  This is NOT
% the approach taken here.
%
% This approach takes advantage of the ability to define
% a Prolog structure with 'hole's and fill in those holes
% later.
%
% To simplify, the system starts by looking to configure
% the door_unit.  So it creates (simplifying) something
% like:
%
%    assembly(door_unit, contains([assembly(frame, X)]))
%
% where 'X' (anything beginning with an upper case letter is
% a variable) is a variable, or hole in the structure.  It will
% be filled in with the contents of the frame.  The rule for
% door_unit then calls the rule for frame to find that value.
%
% The rule(s) for frame return similar structures, also with
% holes for doors, then hinges, and anything else that needs
% to be included.
%
% This way a full structure is built up, from the top down,
% that represents the final configuration.
