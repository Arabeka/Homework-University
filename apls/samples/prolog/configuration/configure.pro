% Configuration System

% The idea is to separate the general purpose reasoning
% logic for the application from the domain-specific
% knowledge.  So this code knows nothing about doors, windows,
% lawn mowers, whatever.

% Initialize, which so far just means wiping out what
% might have been 'known' from the last run of the system.

initialize :-
   abolish(known/2).

% A special test case entry point that asserts the known
% facts without exercising the dialog with the user part of
% the system.  To use it, rename it to initialize, and rename
% the real one above to something else.

% A predicate to get the main product, which will be a
% door_unit for the sample.

get_product(Product, assembly(Product, 1, Properties, Contains)) :-
   get_component(Product, Properties, Contains).

% Just a layer between generic and the actual knowledge.  No
% use is made of the layer right now, but, for example, tracing
% information could be including for testing and debugging
% the knowledge base.

get_bill_of_materials(Unit, BoM) :-
   bill_of_materials(Unit, BoM).

% Called from the knowledge base to get all the required parts
% for the assemblies in a contained list.  In other words, it is
% used in recursive calls as the assembly is walked.

get_bom(contains(Cs), BoM) :-

% Again, a simple layering, not taken advantage of, but
% could be used to add diagnostic information.

get_component(Component, Properties, Contains) :-
   component(Component, Properties, Contains).

% The basic ask/2 predicate.  The first time it will
% ask a question, and remember the answer in a known/2
% fact.  Subsequent queries for a given attribute
% will just used the saved result.
%
% This will also allow for the editing of previous answers,
% changing the configuration and the like.
